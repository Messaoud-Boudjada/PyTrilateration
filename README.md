# PyTrilateration
Trilateration with python is a script to calculate the Trilateration for 3 points usually used in GPS systems 
According to wikipedia
In geometry, trilateration is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of 
distances, using the geometry of circles, spheres or triangles.
In addition to its interest as a geometric problem, trilateration does have practical applications in surveying and navigation,
including global positioning systems (GPS). In contrast to triangulation, it does not involve the measurement of angles.
In this project we try to do the calculation using python prohramming language.

In order to use the project you have to install python 2.7 got to http://python.org
to run the script go to the command line and type python Trilateration.py
